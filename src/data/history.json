        "description": "Stingbies make their debut in Super Mario 3D Land, and are first encountered in World 2-4. They are common in levels taking place in the sky or over large pits. Stingbies fly at a certain height and cannot move up or down; rather, they patrol the area to find Mario or Luigi. When a Stingby spots Mario or Luigi, they angrily start to slowly chase after them. These enemies can be easily defeated by any form of attack."

Its emblem is similar to Honey Queen's, but is rather a stylized depiction of a Stingby from an overhead view. Stingby is unlockable in version 1.0.0, but made available from the start following a software update. It shares statistics with Toad, Toadette, Koopa Troopa, Shy Guy, Lakitu, Nabbit, and Cheep Cheep."
